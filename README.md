## Small Java Tasks

This repo shall serve as an overview of different small tasks which I encountered while learning JAVA.
Each class can be seen as one task and will be executed in the App.java main method.

Some task example are:
- Sort algorithm
- Search algorithm
- Linear datastructure
- Recursive approach
