## Small Java Tasks

This repo shall serve as an overview of different small tasks which I encountered while learning JAVA.
Each class can be seen as one task and will be executed in the App.java main method.

Some task example are:
- Sort algorithm
- Search algorithm
- Linear datastructure
- Recursive approach

I know that such tasks are already described in java library and can be imported and used very easily.
But at the beginning, before using suchs libraries, I want to make sure that those topics are completely comprehensive to me
to adapt and use suchs methods properly.


## Linked List

For the linear datastructe, two classes are needed. The first creates the list (LinkedList.java) and the second describes the node
(LinkedNode.java).

## Prime Number test

This task shall evaluate if the input number is a prime number or not (PrimeNumberTest.java).
